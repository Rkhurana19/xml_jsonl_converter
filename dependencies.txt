Note: To successfully convert documents from xml to jsonl, one must install the following script developed by blackrock: https://github.com/blackrock/xml_to_json

How to use:
1. Navigating to the folder where blackrock's script is located, run the following command to batch convert a folder of xml files:

python xml_to_json.py -e "INSERT XPATH QUERIES HERE" -x "INSERT PATH TO XSD FILE" "INSERT PATH TO XML FILES"

2. To concatenate the resulting jsonl files and cleanly format them (one on each line), run the script in the repo from the CLI:

python join_jsonl.py -d "INSERT PATH TO JSONL FILES" -o "ENTER OUTPUT FILE NAME"
